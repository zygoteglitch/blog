# Maybe tonight

Tonight we're suppose to make dinner. Lately everytime we hang out I prepare myself to not hang out with her; something always seems to come up. If it's not a family emergency, it's her wanting to stay at home and recover from being worn out... almost every single time. It's like pulling teeth.

I really want to see her. She mentioned we should hang out tomorrow as well, because of Thanksgiving and myself going to Florida. We won't see each other for a week. It's a nice thought to hang out 2 days in a row, but the chance of that happening is on par with pigs flying. We'll see. I still have hope.
