# Welcome back

Well, that was as close as I wanted to come with breaking up with her. We talked it out last night and both apologized for how stupidly we acted towards each other, which was nice. We didn't blame the other person, but instead blamed ourselves because we realized our own actions pissed off the other person. I really hope we can continue on this path from where we left off. I know we can. 

Towards the end of the night we started laughing about how rediculous the situation was. It really felt good to laugh about it! It felt good to put it behind us and concentrate on today and the future. I think that's what makes us work... we can work through problems, talk them out, and come to an understanding. This is why we're good together. Most couples I think have problems talking things out in a mature way; they have issues getting to a compromise. Each person is unwilling to budge and see the situation from the other person's point of view. Never once in last nights conversation did we accuse each other of something. We worked it out.
