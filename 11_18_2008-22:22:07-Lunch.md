# Lunch

I went and got some lunch with her today. She told me about all the stuff that has been going on these last few days. I can't even imagine to begin what it must feel like to be in her shoes. She's a strong one to say the least. 

The one thing that frightens me is that all these things she's dealing with will drive us apart because she won't have time for us. That's probably a crappy thing to say right now, but I've said it. You know what? I'll wait. I'll wait till her life settles down from all this chaos. Why will I wait? Because I've never met anyone so real, genuine, honest, and caring before. I've learned so much from her these last few months, and to give up on the possibility of learning more is a rediculous thought. I know she wants to be with me, but I think she feels bad she can't give it "her all" at the moment. I understand that, and I really hope she understands that I do understand. Everyone has their moments in life where it seems like the world has fallen on them. I think the one thing you can't do at times like those is ignore the things that make you happy. Without a shimmer of happiness, how can one hope? 

I'm going to refrain from asking her to hang out with me. I'm going to let her bring up. I think that's the best thing I can hope for while she sorts some things out. Thinking back 4 months ago, I wouldn't have imagined that I'd feel this way about her. Over time though, she grabbed my heart and merged it with her own. 

We've never said the 'love' word. Once you say that word, everything will change. I think it has to change if that word is said. I've had thoughts before wondering if she's someone I could "love". At this moment in time, the answer is a resounding "yes". Is the timing right to say it? Not at all. Will the timing be right? Hopefully someday! We'll see where this goes. I just enjoy riding this wave with her. Best ride of my life.
