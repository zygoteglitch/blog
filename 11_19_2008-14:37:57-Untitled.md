# Last night

Last night was a pretty typical night in my household of 1. I talked to her for a little while on the phone. It was nice she called. I'm always happy to talk to her. I partook last night as well. 

I've been trying not to think about her as much. I realize when I do think about her so often, it really fucks with my head. I'm always wondering if she's thinking about me. Will she call? How does she feel about us? I'm starting to realize, a little late in the game, that I'm thinking about things I have no control over. Would be nice if I did, but I'm realistic! 

On to other news. I'm asking for a few days off at the end of this month. I'm asking for 6 days off. I plan on driving to Florida to get away. I'm thinking maybe if I'm gone that will make her realize we shouldn't give up. I plan on just hanging out at the beach or whatever. Wish I knew some people around there so I could hang out with them, but alas, I'm a one man show these days.
