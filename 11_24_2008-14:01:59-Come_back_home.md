# Come back home

Sitting here on the porch, with coffee in hand, smoke in hand, looking at the freshly fallen snow, and listening to William Fitzimmons. I wish I could sit here all day. I have no motivation to work today, this week; heck, I haven't had any motivation for the last month to work. She's on my mind all the damn time. I just wish it would return to the way it was. Listening to the new Fitzimmons there's a song on his album called "If you would come back home". He sings, "I'll be glad to mend the pieces". Such a simple line, but that's what I want to do with her right now. I want to fix this. I think the only thing that will fix this is time. No other way around it. If there was another path, I'd find it... I'd take it straight to her heart. Instead it's an obstacle course we have to navigate. Such is life I guess. 

She sent me a text this morning. Normally she doesn't text me that early in the morning. I guess I did kind of blow up her phone last night. To be honest, I was real lonely last night sitting here in my flat. I'm good at being alone, but sometimes even experience in that department can't prevent the inevitable; needing someone to talk to. Of course I called her and she didn't answer. She's always dealing with something. I wish she would deal with us.
