# I wonder where she is

She was suppose to come over 40 minutes ago, and she's not here yet. She's always late. One of these days she might be on time. Who knows. Is that too much to ask? I don't feel so important at the moment. Maybe a phone call saying, "Hey, something came up", because that's what I usually get...a phone call stating just that.

Sorry... somewhat frustrated at the moment.
