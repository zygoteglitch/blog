# I'll wait

I told her a little while ago that I'll wait until she sorts this all out. I'll do whatever it is. I won't smoother her. I'll give her space. I'll always be there for her though, even if we're not together. 

The other night I'd told her I'd leave if that's what would make her the most happy in the long run. She said "Don't do that"... so here I am... waiting this thing out. Waiting for life to give her a bit of a happy streak. Waiting for everything to work out.
