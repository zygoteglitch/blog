# Adventures in my head

It's been a rocky past couple of days. Her and I almost broke up. I admit, there are times when I do get disappointed that we can't hang out as often as I like, but I do understand that there's a lot of chaos going on in her life at the moment, and family does come first, and it comes before what we have. I think that's fair, right?

Saturday was hell. We text messaged back and forth. She sent me all these texts saying she couldn't do this, and I didn't understand her situation, and she just needs time alone. She said she'd call to talk about it later on in the day, but then sent me a text she needed time alone to think. I told her I understand, but deep down inside I really wish she would have called. After sending texts like that, and not calling me, hurt a lot. 

Sunday she came over after work and we talked things out. I asked for one more chance to prove to her that I do understand, because I really do. I just think I get selfish sometimes because I want to be with her. She is my light, and without her I feel like I'm living in the shadows sometimes. I guess that's a normal feeling, right? 

After our talk, which turned out pretty good, we decorated my tree and the rest of my flat. It's looking nice and Christmas'y! Once the decorating was complete, we did the "make up" 'thing'. :)

So it was a weekend of being down and out, and then I got rocketed back up to cloud 9. I'm not a fan of so many emotions in very little time. Hopefully cloud 9 is here to stay (for awhile)!
