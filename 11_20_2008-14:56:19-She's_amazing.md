# She's amazing

Last night we went out to get some dinner and it was absolutely wonderful. It was like old times. It was like we never had a discussion of taking a break. The conversation over dinner was real. She seemed really relaxed, dispite the circumstances she has going on in her life. She really
amazed me.

After dinner we went back to my place for a bit for some arts and crafts and a mini make-out session. She hasn't kissed me like that in awhile.
She pulled me closer. She made her little "ooo" sound. She looked at me in a way she's never looked at me before... in a good way of course. 

She even sent me a good night text last night, which is something she hasn't done for some time. 

Maybe she's coming around. Granted, it's hard to judge something like this based on 1 time of hanging out after not hanging out for awhile, but
we'll see. I'm hopeful right now.

This morning in the coffee shop she came over by me for a few minutes and chatted. That's something else that hasn't happened in a long time. I'm feeling good today. I'm feeling like we're looking up. That's all I'm going to say. I don't want to jinx this hot streak.
