# What a weekend

I don't even know where to start. All that I guess I can say is that I screwed up. I asked her to go out on a date night, and she got mad because she had other plans; getting her hair cut. I got a little sad, and she got frustrated because she said she's always the one turning me down when I want to do things. I just wanted one night with her and have some fun. Saturday I went over to her house unannounced to talk. She wouldn't come out of her room and told me to leave via text messages. I left. I feel like shit. Haven't talked to her since. I just want to make things right, and I think my intentions screwed it up. I fuckin' hate myself right now. I let the best thing I've ever had slip away.
