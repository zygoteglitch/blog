#In New Orleans

Here I am in New Orleans. I originally went to Pananma City but decided to drive to New Orleans after all the rain in Panama City. It's nice to be back in New Orleans. This is my third time touring this sweet voodootastic city. However, I must say, something has changed about it. No surprise really, right? Katrina did quite a bit of damage here. Driving into the city I saw a lot of devesation. It's amazing how much cleanup still has to be done. Kind of sad to be honest.

Anyways, I've talked to her twice now in the last 4 days. I wish she'd call more often, or I wish she'd answer when I called her. I wish she was more aware of my needs. That'd be a dream. She did send me 3 hot pics of herself. She's so beautiful. I could go for one of her sweet, sweet kisses right about now!

Well, gotta finish this breakfast and check out of the hotel. No idea what the plan is today, but we'll figure it out!
