No surprise she didn't call last night. I wasn't expecting a call, but part of me was hoping for one. Or even a text message saying, "Hey, I'm pretty tired. Gonna head to bed." That'd be great! I just feel like when she says she's going to call, and she doesn't, she doesn't respect me. I know that sounds bad, but it's not that big of deal. I guess I just want to be important enough where she thinks of me. If she purposely doesn't call for whatever reason, maybe to try and agitate me a bit to drive me away, then please tell me. I don't want to play games. 

I was really hoping to see her this weekend, but thankfully I had some arts and crafts to take my mind off of her. I went for a drive on Saturday. I think I drove around for about 4 hours. I hung out with a friend Saturday night and had some pizza and beer. Sunday was a pretty boring day, though I did stop in the coffee shop to see her briefly after her shift. If I didn't stop in to see her, maybe I would have had a chance to hang out with her. Gosh. Why can't we fix this?! I'm not asking for marriage. I just want to be a part of her life, and she seems damn scared to let that happen.

Maybe she feels scared because she's never felt anything like this before. I know she wants to be with me. I know she likes me. And I know she has things she has to work out in her own life, but we all have those things. No reason to push something away that makes you happy. That's the hardest.
