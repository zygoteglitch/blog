Welcome to my blog. It's all about life. It's all about happiness. It's all about sadness. It's all about the times we struggle to better off ourselves. It's about love. It's about disappointment. The struggles within verse the fake persona we all wear like a mask. Words are just words, but actions always speak louder than words.

I'm trying to make things work. I'm trying my hardest, but sometimes even that isn't enough I guess. We can't always achieve what we loathe. We can't always fix things that are unfixable. But why give up? Why give up wondering only later to ask yourself, "What if I tried _____?". We're human, and I guess one of the joys of being human is to fail, then to get back up and try to make it right the next time. Right? 

Is it 'love'? I guess we all know when it's 'love', but sometimes we're scared to say it. Senses of passion, respect, honesty and just being a beautiful person all around make it easy to give 'love'. I'd much rather give 'love', then receive it. Knowing you can whole heartedly trust someone, respect someone, and realize they are your diamond is what's important to me. If you give 'love', 'love' will find you.
