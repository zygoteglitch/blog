# Come with me

I finished recording a song last night titled "Come with me". It's entirely about 'her'. I'm about to play it for her in my truck once we she gets off work and I journey to my lunch break. I really hope she likes it. I played it for her once; just me and my acoustic guitar. Now there's more guitars and it's more layered. I layered my vocals as well. I honestly think it sounds pretty good. Each recording I do gets better and better, which is a plus, right?

Anyways, I'm really dying to hang out with her. We've only hung out twice in the last week. We use to hang out a lot more, but then all this shit went down which prohibited some quality hanging out time. I hope that maybe after xmas we start hanging out more.

Speaking of xmas. I talked to her mom, and decided to surprise her when she goes 'back home' to visit. I'm hoping she doesn't get mad about this. I've honestly had this idea for the last 2 months or so. Seems crazy... I know... but I think it could potentially surprise her. Here's my plan on how this is going to go down. It's a pretty simple plan. I'm going to find a big box, put a bow on it, call her mom when I'm at the house, get inside the box, wait for her to come up and look at the box (which I'll be in), and then have her open the box, and I'll be inside. Sounds pretty lame typing it out, but it sounds a lot better in my head. We'll see how it goes! Hopefully she won't find this github blog of mine ;-)
