I miss sitting on my porch drinking wine with her talking about our childhood. I miss learning about her. I miss hearing her laugh. I miss her soft touch. I miss the way she'd smile at me through the glass door leading up to my apartment. I miss her cats. I miss making dinner plans and running to the grocery store the night before to buy the ingrediants, only to remember the next day that I forgot to buy the milk! I miss the late nights we had staying up and just talking... getting lost in each other. What changed?
