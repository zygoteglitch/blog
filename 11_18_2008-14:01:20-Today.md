# Today

I wonder if she'll be around today. Didn't hear from her last night, but I didn't expect to either. I'm sure she had some shit to deal with. She probably wasn't in the most talkative mood either. I know I wouldn't have been. I just hope she's ok. I hope her family is ok. Wish I knew how she was doing. Maybe I'll find out today.
