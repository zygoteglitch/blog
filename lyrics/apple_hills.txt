Apple hills on dusty plains
and reckless young, crippled, trust.
Marksman down again outside!
An empty barrel made its mark.
Smiles followed by stars,
outside for all, but inside my heart,
rock-filled sky falls without a start.
A clock strikes 11 the lesson's dead.
Leather dreams and walls between,
unlocked doors through a makers mark,
feather floors, alabaster doors,
such a sweet smell raise the bar.
Running roads with avid dreams,
filmed from inside needles bleed,
headband of one army strong,
time is right I need no more.
