We're past the point of no return
we can't go back, we must press on
we must press on

A single light that turned to two
inside of me, inside of you
inside of you

(
	we've got to try and see this through
	please hold my hand this seems unreal
) x2
	
this seems unreal
this seems unreal

and if this takes our breath away
don't shut your eyes, take in the light
take in the light

If it's a dream then let me sleep
and if it's not, the thoughts of you
thoughts of you I keep


(
	we've got to try and see this through
	please hold my hand this seems unreal
) x2

this seems unreal
this seems unreal

there's something more and something great
we can't give up and let it by
there's something there that lives inside
we can't give up and let it by

(
	we've got to try and see this through
	please hold my hand this seems unreal
) x2

this seems unreal
this seems unreal

We're past the point of no return
we can't go back, we must press on
we must press on

A single light that turned to two
inside of me, inside of you
inside of you
