Verse 1
-------
	Tell me what I should do,
	when I'm thinking of you.
	And the words you had said,
	getting stuck in my head.
	When you're sitting with me,
	we make great company.
	Till the night disappears,
	and I've lost, I fear...

Pre Chorus
----------
	Getting by
	Getting by
	Getting by
	Getting by

Chorus
------
	What if I was
	all you ever need?
	We could be you and me,
	so long.
	Time is not lost,
	in a photograph.
	We could be here,
	all the while.
	
Verse 2
-------
	Tell me what can I say,
	when you're drifiting away.
	And I can't figure out,
	everything you want.
	Can we make it from here,
	will the world disappear?
	And we'll lose all our fears,
	when it all comes clear.
	
Pre Chorus
----------
	Getting by
	Getting by
	Getting by
	Getting by

Chorus
------
	What if I was
	all you ever need?
	We could be you and me,
	so long.
	Time is not lost,
	in a photograph.
	We could be here,
	all the while.
	What if I was
	all you ever need?
	We could be you and me,
	so long.
	Time is not lost,
	in a photograph.
	We could be here,
	all the while.
