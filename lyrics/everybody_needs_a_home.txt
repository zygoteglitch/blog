let's float away into the sea
and share some time where lovers meet
we're wrapped around a shared embrace
we've spun a web and emptied space

a silent stare that freezes time
I pray to God I won't go blind
we're wrapped around a shared embrace
we've spun a web and emptied space

It's time like these that mean the most

Everybody needs a home
everybody needs someone 
to show them how to get along

the wind picks up this feeling sores
the clouds of nine are now the norm
we're wrapped around a shared embrace
we've spun a web and emptied space
