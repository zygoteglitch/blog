Come with me and drop your fear
but only if you want to
Lay me down and watch the sky
that's a million miles wide
I'll be right here to hold your hand
but only if you want to
Keep me close yet far away
it's your heart that means the most to me

Come with me and feel the breeze
but only if you want to
Here I am and there you are
sitting by your seashore
I'll stand right here and wait for you
like a statue near the waves
Kiss me hard but soft as clouds
it's your heart that means the most to me

Come with me so tenderly
but only if you want to
I'll believe in all your dreams
and all the things you wish for
Make me see and believe in me
but only if you want to
Close your eyes but feel me breath
it's your heart that means the most to me

Come with me and shed your skin
but only if you want to
Let's be still and beautiful
cause sometimes that's the best
Time stands still inside our worlds
are we on a carousel?
Wonderful, so delicate
it's your heart that means the most to me
