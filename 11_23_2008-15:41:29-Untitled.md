She finally did come over last night; an hour and half late. She did call and she kinda broke down on the phone because of all the crap that's been going on with her and her family. The events in her life will not end up in this blog. 

Last night when she called she said she just might stay at home. I convinced her to come over for 2.5 hours. We sat on the couch, listened to tunes, watched some TV, arts & crafts, and "other things". I must say the "other things" were simply incredible. 

End of line.
